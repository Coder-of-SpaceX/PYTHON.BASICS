# Squares of Numbers Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 along with their squares. Hint: Use range(1, 11) and i*i
for a in range(1,11):
	print(a * a)

# Write a program using a for loop to calculate the sum of all elements.
total = 0
nums = [5,8,12,20,7]
for b in nums:
	total = total + b
	print(total)

# Nested loops 
list3 = ["Divine Lovers","God and Goddess","Creators"]
list4 = ["RadhaKrishna","Parwatishiv","SaraswatiBrahma"]
for l in list3:
    for m in list4:
        print(l,m)
